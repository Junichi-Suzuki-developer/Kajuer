# Kajuer
MNIST digit recognition using Spiking Neural Network (SNN)

## The basis
This simulation is based on the 3 great works.

### Neuron model
Izhikevich neuron model is simple and have the great potential to solve many types of problems.

And this is embedded in this simultaion.

See the reference https://www.izhikevich.org/publications/spikes.pdf

### Network model
Diehl & Cook Spiking Neural Network model is one of the most powerful solution to MNIST digit recognition problems.

This simulation embedds the essence of Diehl & Cook's work's network characteristics.

See the reference https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2015.00099/full

### Supervised STDP model
Supervised STDP model is charactered as the potentially both positive and negative weighed synapses.

This can improve the digit recognition accuracy.

# Preparation
## for Manjaro Linux
1. Install intel-oneapi-basekit package.

Use below command to install the dependencies.

```
pamac install intel-oneapi-basekit
echo -e 'source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

2. Chaeck out repository.

Check out this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/Junichi-Suzuki-developer/Kajuer.git
```

# Running a simulation
1. Run a simulation.

Use below command to run a simulation.

```
cd Kajuer
./exec.sh
```

Depending on the machine power, it will take about 2 or more hours to complete the simulation.

# Simulation parameters
Modifiable parameters are stored in the file `Kajuer/Param/Param.h`.

If you would like to try another parameter set, modify it and just run `exec.sh` again.

Almost all of parameters are with comments as you can interpret what it is.

# How to interpret results
`exec.sh` outputs 3 types of log files in `Kajuer` directory.

## fire_record.txt
It will contain MNIST digit recognition results.

For example, it will contain such like below many times.

```
label_answer: 9 7 false
```

- "label_answer:" is just a label so this can be ignorable here.

- "9" is the Answer of Spiking Neural Network. What they recognize the digit as is described.

- "7" is the correct answer label, so in this example Spiking Neural Network failed to recognize the digit.

- "false" means recoginition result is not the same as the answer label.

This infomration can help visualize the recognition accuracy progress.

## spike_records
### training_spike_record.txt.*
This contains the spike information during the training phase.

For example, it will contain such like below many times.

```
108 55
```

This infomration can help visualize the spike history.

- "108" is the simulation time elapsed in milliseconds.

- "55" is the spiked output neuron index.

### validation_spike_record.txt.*
This contains the spike information during the validation phase.

Contents are the same format as training_spike_record.txt.*.

## weight_map_dir
### weight_map.bin.*
This contains the raw weight values, binary format, of Simulations' output neuron layer at the time.

For example, "weight_map.bin.50000" will contain the weight map when the simulation time elapsed in 50000 milliseconds.

This information can help visualize the weight change history.
